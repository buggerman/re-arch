## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### 🚨 **If archinstall Fails**

**💾 During disk setup:**
- 📏 **Check disk space**: Ensure 20GB+ available
- 💿 **Try different disk**: Some disks have compatibility issues
- 🔄 **Reboot and retry**: Sometimes a fresh start helps

**📦 During package downloads:**
- 🌐 **Check internet**: Run `ping google.com`
- 🪞 **Try different mirror**: Reboot installation media and try again
- ⏳ **Wait and retry**: Sometimes mirrors are temporarily busy

**🔗 Config URL not found:**
- 🔄 **Use alternative URLs**: The GitHub URLs in documentation as fallback
- 🌐 **Check internet**: Ensure you can access websites

### 🚨 **If re-arch-lite.sh Fails**

**🔒 Permission errors:**
```bash
# Ensure you're root in chroot:
whoami          # Should show "root"
id              # Should show uid=0(root)
```

**🌐 Network issues in chroot:**
```bash
# Copy DNS configuration:
cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
# Then re-enter chroot and try again
```

**📦 Package conflicts:**
- 🔄 **Retry once**: Sometimes transient network issues cause failures
- 🐛 **If repeated failures**: Report as bug with error output

### 🚨 **Boot Issues After Installation**

**Black screen or boot failure:**
1. **Boot from Arch ISO again**
2. **Mount your system**: `mount /dev/sdaX /mnt` (replace X with partition)
3. **Chroot**: `arch-chroot /mnt`
4. **Reinstall GRUB**: 
   ```bash
   grub-install /dev/sda  # Replace with your disk
   grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
   ```

**No GRUB menu appears:**
- **Check BIOS boot order**: Ensure hard disk is first
- **Check UEFI settings**: Ensure Secure Boot is disabled
- **Try booting from snapshot**: Advanced options in GRUB

**Login issues:**
- **Default credentials**: Try `user` / `rearch` if you didn't change them
- **Reset password from live USB**:
  ```bash
  mount /dev/sdaX /mnt
  arch-chroot /mnt
  passwd username  # Change password for your user
  ```

### 🚨 **KDE/Desktop Issues**

**Desktop doesn't load:**
- **Check SDDM**: Should see graphical login, not text
- **Try different session**: Select different desktop environment in SDDM
- **Check logs**: `journalctl -b` for boot errors

**No audio:**
```bash
# Check PipeWire status:
systemctl --user status pipewire

# Restart audio:
systemctl --user restart pipewire
```

**No network:**
```bash
# Check NetworkManager:
sudo systemctl status NetworkManager

# Restart networking:
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### 🚨 **Snapshot Recovery**

If your system breaks after changes:

**Boot from snapshot:**
1. **Reboot**
2. **Select "Advanced options for Arch Linux"** in GRUB
3. **Choose "Arch Linux snapshots"**
4. **Select a snapshot from before the problem**

**Rollback to snapshot:**
```bash
# List snapshots:
sudo snapper list

# Rollback to specific snapshot:
sudo snapper rollback 5  # Replace 5 with snapshot number

# Reboot to activate:
sudo reboot
```
